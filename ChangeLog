randtype 1.13
  * Makefile portability fix
  * fix free() in parse_replace() (linux)

randtype 1.12
  * added option -r to replace a string with another (see manpage). thanks to
    Dan Stubbs for the strrep() function
  * fixed time value bugs (i hope)

randtype 1.11
  * the argument format for the -d option has changed. it must begin with
    either a , or . to specify the direction of characters to dump left or
    right of the dump string respectively (see manual page)

randtype 1.10
  * added generated mistakes command line option -m

randtype 1.9
  * new author address (bjk@arbornet.org)
  * small code and Makefile cleanups
  * should build on just about anything
  * removed long option arguments (for portability)
  * removed debian stuff as I don't have a way to maintain the control files
    right now
  * added LICENSE and BUGS to the archive; renamed NEWS to ChangeLog
  * support for gzip compressed files

randtype 1.8
  * small cleanups
  * debianized

randtype 1.7
  * uses select() instead of usleep() for efficientcy (about 20 times faster)
  * added command line option --quit to quit after a certain amount of
    seconds which adds a signal handler (sigaction())
  * removed MSDOS/WIN32 port (who cares? say so if you do.)

randtype 1.6
  * MSDOS/WIN32 uses GNU getopt now (forgot about the damn licensing issues)
  * default timing values for MSDOS/WIN32 a bit saner as they don't work the
    same as in Linux for some reason

randtype 1.5
  * updated to work with MSDOS/WIN32. Note that random number generation sucks
    in this environment, and doesn't work near as well as it does in say,
    Linux. :)
  * the --wait option does not require --char-time anymore as it defaults to
    the same as --time (specified at compile time)
  * added a manual page

randtype 1.4
  * added command line option --lines (-l) for outputting lines at random
    intervals. only the --time option is used with this

randtype 1.3
  * --magic long option replaced with --dump-string
  * --nowait long option renamed to --no-wait
  * added short --kill command line option -k
  * added --wait (-w) command line option (see README)
  * added --char-time command line option for use with --wait
  * small cleanups

randtype 1.2
  * multiple files may be specified. if none are specifed, stdin is assumed.
  * defaults for --time are specified at compile time
  * magic strings in lines read from stdin work now

randtype 1.1
  * new command line option `--magic' replaces old builtin magic string.
  * new command line option `kill' to specifically kill the magic string on
    output. the default is to display it.
  * new command line option `--nowait' to dump specific characters
    immediately. special characters can be escaped (ie: '\n\t' etc...)
  * some small code cleanups :)

randtype 1.0
  * initial release
