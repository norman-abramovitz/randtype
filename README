Randtype is a small utility to output characters or lines at random intervals.
There are a few command line options to refine the output. Type `randtype -h'
or read the manual page after installation to see an explanation of them.

Installation:
-------------
Edit the Makefile to change some defaults or just type `make' to compile the
program, and `make install' to install it.
